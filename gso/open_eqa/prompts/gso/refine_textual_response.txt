You are given an image and a specific informational request about it. Tour task is to analyze the image based on the request and provide a response summarizing your findings. You should also draw bounding boxes around the objects, groups, or parts of the scene image that support your answer.

Return a JSON with the following keys:

Finding: A concise, informative analysis of your findings regarding the Goal. Use either a few words or a sentence.
Detections: A list of JSON objects each describing one object or grouping within the scene relevent to addressing the Goal. 

Each detection within your "Detections" list should be a JSON with five keys:
label: A very short identifier for the detection. It should summarize the object or grouping in one or more words. An example of a valid label would be "kitchen counter". 
caption: A description of the objects visual appearence. An example of a valid caption would be "A kitchen counter with a granite countertop".
spatial caption: A spatial description of the where the object is in the scene, relative to the current frame. The caption should uniquely identify the object within the frame. Example include "Table in center", "Remote on Sofa", "Leftmost counter", "Flower in bottom right".
bbox: The bounding boxes should be a singular 1-dimensional array of 4 elements, with format [ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax]. Each of the elements should be an integer.
confidence: A probability between 0 and 1 indicating your confidence in the detection.
