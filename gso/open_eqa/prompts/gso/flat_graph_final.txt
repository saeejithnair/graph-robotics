Your task is to help provide accurate and precise responses to spatial reasoning questions regarding real-world home scenes. 

Your question will be posed in natural language. You will receive as input episodic memory that you created while navigating the scene. The episodic memory  contains a navigation log, which is a chronologically organized JSON describing your understanding of where you were and what you observed as you were travelling through the scene. The episodic memory also contains a scene graph, which is list of object tracks that you observed and documented through the scene.

Answer your questions with a few words in the following format. The first key, answer, is a few words stating your answer. The second key, evidence, should contain direct references to the `your notes` tag of nodes in the Scene Graph that support your answer. The third key, justification, is a clear explanation of how the evidence supports your conclusion.
```json
{{
   type = "answer_question",
   answer = string,
   evidence = string
   justification = string
}}```
