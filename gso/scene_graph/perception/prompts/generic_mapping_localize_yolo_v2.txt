Write captions for a list of candidate detections, localize your position and describe your field of view within the environment.

Here are your candidate detections. Their bounding boxes are accurate but thier object classes are imprecise:
{detections}

Return a JSON with the following keys:
Current Location: The current room or area (e.g., "washroom," "hallway," "stairs," "kitchen").
View:  A description of the visible portion of the scene (e.g., "left side of the garage"). Avoid camera angle descriptions.
Summary: Highlight noteworthy observations (e.g., "spotted a vase on the table").
Detections: An array of JSON objects, each describing an item in the scene. The length of your the detection list should correspond to the length of the candidate detections.

Each detection within your "Detections" list should be a JSON with five keys:
label: A short, descriptive label that visually distinguishes the object from others in the frame (e.g., "kitchen counter").
visual caption: A description of the object's visual appearence. An example of a valid caption would be "A kitchen counter with a granite countertop".
bbox: A 1D array of four integers representing the bounding box: [ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax].
confidence: A float indicating how confident you are in the bounding box and visual caption being correct.
