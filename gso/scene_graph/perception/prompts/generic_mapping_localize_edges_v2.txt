Detect items, identify the spatial relationships (on, inside, and part of) among the detections, localize your position, and describe your field of view within the scene. 

Return a JSON with the following keys:

Current Location: The current room or area (e.g., "washroom," "hallway," "stairs," "kitchen") the image is taken from.
View: A description of the visible portion of the scene (e.g., "left side of the garage"). Avoid camera angle descriptions.
Summary: Highlight noteworthy observations (e.g., "spotted a vase on the table").
Detections: An array of JSON objects, each describing a detected object or group. 

Each detection within your "Detections" list should be a JSON with five keys:
label: A unique and concise identifier (e.g. "kitchen counter"). 
visual caption: A description of the object's visual appearence (e.g., "A kitchen counter with a granite countertop").
spatial caption: A spatial description of the objects location in the current frame or view. The caption should uniquely identify the object within the frame. Examples include "Table in center", "Remote on Sofa", "Leftmost counter", "Flower in bottom right".
bbox: A 1D array of four integers representing the bounding box: [ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax].
confidence: A confidence score between 0 and 1.
relationships: A list of JSON objects describing the "on", "inside" and "part of" relationships with other detections in the scene. 

Each JSON object within the "relationships" should have the following keys:
related_object_label: The label of the related object (e.g., if the detected object is "laptop" and it's "on" the "table" then the related_object_label would be "table", if the detected object is "apple" and it's "inside" the "fridge" then the related_object_label would be "fridge").
relationship_type: Must be one of:
- "on": Used when one object is physically resting on another object (e.g., "laptop on table," "rice on bowl"). Avoid assigning "on" to objects partially leaning against others (e.g., "painting on wall").
- "inside": Used when an object is fully or mostly enclosed within another (e.g., "apple inside fridge," "pants inside dresser," "hands inside pockets"). Avoid using "inside" for objects partially sticking out of containers unless the enclosure is dominant.
- "part of": Used for components or integral parts of an object (e.g., "door part of car," "handle part of door," "zipper part of backpack"). Avoid using "part of" for objects that are merely associated or adjacent.
