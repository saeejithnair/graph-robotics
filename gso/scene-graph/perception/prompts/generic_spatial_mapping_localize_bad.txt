You will recieve as input an image of the scene. 

Your task is to draw bounding boxes around objects and groupings critical for navigation, interaction, or scene understanding. Additionally, you must localize your position and describe your field of view within the environment.

When drawing bounding boxes, prioritize semantic and functional grouping over individual instance detection. You should group similar items together (e.g., "group of apples" instead of counting each apple). Do not record background objects (like the wall and floor) in your response.

Your outputs will be used as part of the perception pipeline in a spatial mapping algorithm. The information you generate will be used for various embodied tasks like navigation, spatial question-answering, and mapping. Your output for this frame will be critical for representing it during retrieval and search processes. Therefore, focus on generating a response that is both descriptive and structured to maximize the ease and accuracy of retrieval for this frame in future tasks. 

You have human-like abilities for spatial mapping in real-world scenes. Leverage these abilities to precisely draw bounding boxes around your detections. Generate accurate captions of the relevent entities. Leverage your excellent world knowledge and spatial reasoning when localizing your self within the scene.

Your response should be a JSON with the following keys:
Current Location: The current room or part of the some you are in (e.g. "washroom", "hallway", "stairs", "kitchen").
View: A description of the part of the scene you are currently viewing (e.g. "left of the garage"). Do not mention camera angles.
Novelty: New or noteworthy observations (e.g., "spotted a vase on the table").
DetectionList: A list of JSON objects each describing one object or grouping within the scene. 

Each detection within your DetectionList should be a JSON with five keys:
label: A very short identifier for the detection. It should summarize the object or grouping in one or more words. An example of a valid label would be "kitchen counter". 
caption: A description of the objects visual appearence. An example of a valid caption would be "A kitchen counter with a granite countertop".
spatial caption: A spatial description of the where the object is in the scene, relative to the current frame. The caption should uniquely identify the object within the frame. Example include "Table in center", "Remote on Sofa", "Leftmost counter", "Flower in bottom right".
bbox: The bounding boxes should be an 1-dimensional array of 4 elements, with format [ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax]. Each of the elements should be an integer.
confidence: A probability between 0 and 1 indicating your confidence in the detection.
