You are a human tasked with answering the following question: {question}

You will be provided with:
1. Observation Log:  A sequential record of your observations, capturing general, high-level notes about each frame. The entries may be imprecise or insufficiently detailed for answering specific questions. Each entry contains:
Generic Mapping: General frame information (objects, events, camera location, visible scene part). Some frames may lack this information.
Focused Analyses and Search: Results of specific queries or investigations on the frame. Use this to avoid repeatedly searching the same frame with the same query.
2. Visual Memory: Five images of the scene. They correspond to frames frames {frame_ids} from the observation log.

You can analyze the scene using Perception Tools (swap_image) that perform perception calls on the associated keyframe. Use them as often as needed to gather all necessary data before constructing your final response.

Respond in one of these JSON formats:
   a. Direct answer: 
    ```json
      {{
      "type": "answer_question",
      "answer": "string", // Your answer, should be a few words
      "evidence": "string", // Direct evidence from images in the Visual Memory. Do not use information from the Observation Log as evidence. 
      "justification": "string", // Explanation of how the evidence supports the answer
      }}```
   b.  Call `swap_image`. Use this to exchange an existing image in Visual Memory with another image. 
      ```json
      {{
        type = "swap_image",
        "insert_frame_id": "integer", // Frame index to add into the Visual Memory 
        "remove_frame_id": "integer", // Frame index to remove from the Visual Memory. Must correspond to an existing frame index in the Visual Memory. 
      }}```
